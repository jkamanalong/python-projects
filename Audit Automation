# Web-based Application Audit Automation Tool

**Automated User Audit Report Generation for a Web-Base Application Platform**

A desktop GUI tool built with **Python**, **PyQt5**, **Selenium**, **xlwings**, and **Pandas** to automate the auditing of user accounts in the Corrigo work order management system.

### Purpose
This tool streamlines a previously manual, time-consuming process:
- Searches for client accounts in Corrigo
- Applies specific filters (including suspended users and last login date)
- Exports user reports to Excel
- Runs post-processing Excel macros to flag issues
- Saves flagged outputs for review

It significantly reduces audit time from hours to minutes per client.

### Features
- Clean PyQt5 GUI for selecting input files and output folders
- Secure login handling via configuration (supports QA/Prod environments)
- Robust Selenium automation with retry logic and window handling
- Integration with Excel via xlwings to trigger VBA macros
- Processes multiple accounts in batch from an input macro-enabled workbook
- Downloads and processes exported reports automatically
- Status tracking directly in the input Excel file

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- PyQt5 – GUI framework
- Selenium WebDriver – Browser automation
- xlwings – Excel automation and macro execution
- Pandas – Data processing
- XML parsing for configuration
