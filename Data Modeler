Semi-Automated Dimensional Modeling Tool for Data Warehousing

A lightweight desktop application built with Python and PyQt5 that helps transform flat fact tables (Excel/CSV) into a proper star schema data model — creating normalized dimension tables and a clean fact table in one intuitive workflow.
Perfect for data analysts, BI developers, and anyone preparing data for Power BI, Tableau, or data warehouses without needing expensive ETL tools.

### Business Impact

Reduced time to build star schema models from hours to minutes
Eliminated manual copy-paste errors when denormalizing data
Enabled non-technical analysts to create clean, query-optimized data models
Produced ready-to-load Excel files with proper fact and dimension tables
Improved report performance and consistency in downstream BI tools

### Key Features

Intuitive PyQt5 GUI with real-time column profiling
Load Excel (multi-sheet) or CSV as the initial fact table
Column analysis table showing:
Data type
Null/empty counts
Distinct values
Total rows

Checkboxes to mark columns as:
Attributes (to move to dimension)
Primary Key (surrogate or business key)

Create multiple dimension tables by selecting attributes
Automatically deduplicates rows
Removes selected attributes from fact table (except PKs)

View list of created dimensions
One-click save to multi-sheet Excel with:
Clean fact table
Separate sheets for each dimension


### Technologies Used

Python 3 – Core language
PyQt5 – Responsive desktop interface
pandas – Data loading, manipulation, and export
openpyxl – Reliable Excel writing with multiple sheets

### How It Works

Load your raw/flat data file (fact table source)
Select sheet (if Excel)
Review column profiles and check:
Attributes you want in a dimension
Primary key columns (stay in fact table for joins)

Enter dimension name → "Create Dimension Table"
Tool extracts unique combinations and creates dim table
Removes redundant attributes from fact table

Repeat for multiple dimensions (e.g., Date, Customer, Product, Location)
Save → get a properly structured star schema Excel file


### Setup and installation: 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-modeler-star-schema.git
cd data-modeler-star-schema
pip install pyqt5 pandas openpyxl
python main.py

### Why This Project Matters for My Portfolio
